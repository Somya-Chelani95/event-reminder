My name is Somya Chelani, a BCA student from Dezyne École College, and I am currently working on a smart College Event Reminder AI Agent as part of our hackathon project. 
This year, our college has collaborated with Sentry,a tech-based company,to encourage students to build real-world, automation-focused solutions. 
Inspired by this collaboration, I chose to solve a common issue students face—missing important college events because checking the website or notice board regularly is difficult.
In this project, all upcoming events are listed in a structured Google Sheet, and using n8n automation, a workflow is created that sends instant notifications directly to the student’s mobile phone via Telegram. 
This ensures that every reminder—whether about seminars, fests, or deadlines—reaches on time. Through this project, I’m learning automation, workflow design, and practical problem-solving with industry-level exposure.
